<h2>Lesson 19 - Particle Engines</h2>

<p>The quadrics example is very easy since three.jsprovides built-in quadrics support. However, as always, there are a couple of wrinkles so let's go over it briefly.</p>
<p>We initialize the gfxScene object same as always. We also declare some global vars:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var quadTexture;
var	quadric;
var	quadGeometry;
var	quadMaterial;
var	materialType = 'p';	// texture, paint or wire
var	quadType = 'b';</code></pre>


        
<p>And that's it!  Go on to the next page to see the actual rendered demo in all it's quadric glory!</p>
